Data Structures & Algorithms Python Projects

This repository contains 6 interactive Python programs demonstrating important data structures and algorithms concepts. Each program is designed to help understand the implementation and application of a specific data structure or algorithm.

Projects Included
1. Trie (Autocomplete System)

Implements a Trie (prefix tree) to store words.

Supports adding words and retrieving autocomplete suggestions based on a prefix.

Interactive console interface for inserting words and querying suggestions.

2. Chess Game (Basic)

A text-based chess game supporting piece movements for pawns.

Validates moves and alternates turns between white and black.

Can be extended to include full chess rules for all pieces.

3. QuadTree (Spatial Indexing)

Stores city coordinates within a defined 2D boundary.

Efficiently queries nearby cities or finds the nearest city to a given point.

Demonstrates hierarchical spatial decomposition and search.

4. Disjoint Set & Kruskal’s Algorithm

Implements a Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure.

Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.

Interactive input for cities and connection costs.

5. Segment Tree

Builds a segment tree for range sum queries on an array.

Supports efficient queries and updates on individual elements.

Demonstrates divide-and-conquer tree structures for interval-based operations.

6. Transport Network (Shortest Path)

Models locations and connections with travel durations.

Computes the shortest path between any two locations using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Outputs the route and total travel time.

Technologies Used

Python 3

Core modules: heapq, numpy (for QuadTree distance calculation)

Concepts covered: Trie, Trees, Graphs, Segment Tree, Disjoint Sets, Dijkstra’s algorithm
